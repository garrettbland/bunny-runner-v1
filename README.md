# Bunny Runner

Bunny Runner was a mobile iOS game that I developed around 2016. It was a platforming game that challenged players to tap and hop on moving platforms. It was inspired by chromes dinosaur game, and Flappy Birds.

The commit history was lost somewhere, but the remaining application can still be found in the directory. Screenshots can also be found in `Bunny Runner Screenshots` that were used for things like the facebook page and the app store submission.
